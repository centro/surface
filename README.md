# Surface

A centralized repository for (S)CSS used on the Centro Insight and Auth projects.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'surface'
    
**For Rails, be sure surace is NOT included in the assets section.  It needs to be along side the other "general" gems
because surface includes helper methods and other non-asset code.**

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install surface
